# Bouncing-Ball-Gaming-On-turbo-c-
Bouncing ball is mini project in C programming. It is simple graphics program for running on graphics installed drivers. This project has written only for to view how the graphics drivers are working in C programming.  Due to technical advances in graphics hardware, some areas of 3D graphics programming have become quite complex. To simplify the process, new features were added to graphics cards, including the ability to modify their rendering pipelines using vertex and pixel shaders.  In the beginning, vertex and pixel shaders were programmed at a very low level with  only the assembly language of the graphics processing unit. Although using the  assembly language gave the programmer complete control over code and flexibility, it  was fairly hard to use. A portable, higher level language for programming the GPU was  needed, so Cg was created to overcome these problems and make shader  development easier.  Some of the benefits of using Cg over assembly are: High level code is easier to learn, program, read, and maintain than assembly  code. Cg code is portable to a wide range of hardware and platforms, unlike assembly  code, which usually depends on hardware and the platforms it's written for.  The Cg compiler can optimize code and do lower level tasks automatically, which  are hard to do and error prone in assembly.
